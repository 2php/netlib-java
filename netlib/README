This folder contains the netlib reference implementations.

The netlib API is a Fortran API. The recommended C interface is via
the CBLAS wrapper (for BLAS) and the LAPACKE wrapper (for LAPACK).

netlib-java uses the C interface for native calls.

Note that the CLAPACK effort is a translation of the Fortran codes into C
and is therefore not as performant as the original Fortran codes - we
do not use CLAPACK.

There is no official C interface to ARPACK.

complex and double complex routines (and empty files dnaupe.f, snaupe.f)
have been removed.

LAPACK ships with a bundled version of BLAS, but we use the original BLAS.
Likewise for ARPACK and BLAS/LAPACK.
